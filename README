MPR Death Report (configured in options, command /MPR) is a system announcing player deaths. It also logs them, joins by encounters and sorts by time, so encounter deaths can be easily checked again after raids or any other time in future.

Another useful thing from the addon users, if you whisper them "raidlocks" or "raid locks", the addon will automatically whisper back list of instances and modes you are locked to.
